# newrian

# The NEWRIAN method was originally written in Matlab and translated into R in 2020. The model is used to obtain soil hydraulic parameters from the measurement results of forest soil samples in the Multistep Outflow experiment (MSO). It is based on the Mualen-van-Genuchten model to obtain information about water retention and hydraulic conductivity. It is based on inverse modeling via the HYDRUS 1D water balance model in conjunction with an optimization algorithm (Annealing Simplex).
